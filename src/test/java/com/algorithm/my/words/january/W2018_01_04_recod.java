     * Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to
     * the proposition that all men are created equal.
     * Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.
     * We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for
     * those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
     * But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground. The brave men, living and
     * dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
     * note, now long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living,
     * rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
     * work which they who fought here, have, thus far, so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
     * great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they
     * here gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation,
     * under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that, government of the people, by the people, for the people,
     * shall not perish from the earth.
